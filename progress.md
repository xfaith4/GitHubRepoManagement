# Progress

## 2026-05-27

- Reconciled the active roadmap against live code and confirmed Release 1.7.5 Phase 4 was still missing in the UI: the backend exposed `topValueItem`, but Work Queue still sorted only by dispatch readiness and showed no value rationale.
- Wired Work Queue to the portfolio assessment model so each ready repo shows its highest-value roadmap item, value score, value tier, and rationale tooltip.
- Updated Work Queue ordering to sort by readiness first and by `topValueItem.valueScore` within each readiness bucket, with pending-count and repo-name fallback ordering.
- Refreshed the Work Queue data path so docs-audit refresh and scan actions also refresh portfolio assessment data, preventing stale value ranking after an audit refresh.
- Updated `ROADMAP.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `docs/reference/portfolio-assessment.md` to mark Release 1.7.5 Phase 4 complete and document the ranking contract.
- Verification passed:
  - `npm run install:frontend`
  - `npm run build`

## 2026-04-26

- Read active roadmap and completed-release archive.
- Identified Release 1.7.5 Phase 2 value ranking as the next roadmap phase.
- Created planning files for this multi-step release task.
- Added `backend/config/value-scoring.json`.
- Added `backend/modules/portfolio/Portfolio.ValueScorer.ps1`.
- Wired portfolio assessment to expose scored `pendingItems` and `topValueItem`.
- Updated API host wiring, frontend types, module smoke coverage, and API host smoke contract checks.
- Verification passed:
  - `pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/Invoke-ModuleSmokeTest.ps1 -WorkspaceRoot "$(pwd)"`
  - `npm run build`
  - PowerShell parser check for API host and portfolio modules
- API host smoke printed `[PASS] API host smoke completed` and validated the expanded portfolio assessment contract; the process did not return after printing the summary, so it was terminated after pass output and no host/test process remains.
- Updated `ROADMAP.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` for Release 1.7.5 Phase 2.
